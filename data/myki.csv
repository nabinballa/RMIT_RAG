question,answer
"Where can I get a Myki?","Cards can be obtained online or by phone (1800 800 007, 6am – midnight daily). You can also get them from Myki Card Vending Machines (located at railway stations, some tram platform stops, and major bus interchanges), from staff at Premium (staffed) stations, staffed V/Line stations (within the Myki boundary), or from PTV Hubs at Southern Cross station, Westfield Shopping Centre, Geelong, and Bendigo Marketplace, Bendigo. Mykis can also be purchased at many metropolitan retail outlets and some country retail outlets, particularly 7-Eleven stores, and some Australia Post outlets in major regional centres. V/Line conductors sell full-fare or concession Mykis, pre-loaded with Myki Money, for travel to and from V/Line stations between Melbourne and Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Traralgon, and Seymour. Only full-fare Mykis can be purchased from Myki vending machines. Concession, child, and seniors Mykis must be bought from other outlets."
"How much does getting a Myki card cost?","The cost of a card is $6 full fare, or $3 concession. The purchase price is not refundable. People eligible for a free Seniors Myki should apply for one as part of their Seniors Card application. Only full-fare Mykis are available from Myki Card Vending Machines. Concession, child, and Seniors cards can be obtained from staffed railway stations, retail outlets, PTV Hubs, or online. Myki Mobile is free for compatible phones."
"Where can I add money to my Myki card?","You can top up your Myki at all the places where you can buy a card, except for locations in regional Victoria that only sell Myki cards pre-loaded with some credit. Bus drivers no longer sell or top up Myki cards."
"Why can’t I get a short-term ticket?","Short-term tickets were planned but not introduced in Melbourne, and were abolished on regional city bus networks. This means anyone wanting to use public transport in Melbourne must have a reusable Myki card with sufficient credit, even for occasional travel. This decision causes difficulties for occasional travellers and those who forget their Myki or have a defective card, as they must purchase a new card and add credit."
"How does Myki Money work?","You buy a reusable Myki card and load credit onto it. As you travel, you touch on and off, and the system debits your card. Melbourne metropolitan fares are: 2-hour Zone 1 or 1+2: $5.50, Zone 2: $3.50; Daily Zone 1 or 1+2: $11.00, Zone 2: $7.50. Concession fares are 50% of these prices. Discounts like Earlybird free travel (before 7:15 a.m.) and Weekend Cap ($7.60, $3.80 concession) apply. A daily cap limits charges to two 2-hour segments. Regional fares differ."
"What is a Myki card?","Myki is a reusable smart card used for public transport in Melbourne, including trains, trams, and buses. You load money or passes onto it to pay for travel."
"How does Myki Pass work?","Myki Pass is a periodical ticket where you load a Myki card with travel for a set number of consecutive days (7 to 365 days) in chosen zones. You pay upfront and can travel as much as you like within those zones during the period."
"What are the weekly (7-day) Myki Pass fares?","For Zone 1+2, a 7-day full fare Myki Pass costs $55.00 and concession $27.50. For Zone 2 only, full fare is $35.00 and concession $17.50."
"How much does a daily rate Myki Pass cost for longer durations (28–365 days)?","For Zone 1+2, full fare is $6.60 per day and concession $3.30 per day. For Zone 2, full fare is $4.20 per day and concession $2.10 per day."
"Is there a discount for long-term Myki Passes?","Yes. When you buy a Myki Pass for 326–365 days, you only pay for 325 days and get up to 40 days free."
"Where can I buy or top up a Myki card?","You can buy or top up Myki cards at train stations, 7-Eleven stores, Myki machines, online at the PTV website, or through the PTV app."
"Can I use Myki on all forms of transport in Melbourne?","Yes, Myki is valid on trains, trams, and buses in the metropolitan Melbourne area and some regional services."
"How do I check my Myki balance?","You can check your balance at Myki machines, online at the PTV website, on the PTV app, or by tapping on a reader when boarding."
"What happens if I forget to tap off Myki?","If you forget to tap off, you may be charged the maximum daily fare for your zone, which could be higher than your actual trip cost."
"Can international students get concession Myki fares?","Yes, international students may qualify for concession fares if their institution participates in the iUSEpass program, offering 50% off annual Myki passes."
"What is the iUSEpass for students?","The iUSEpass provides eligible international students with a 50% discount on an annual Myki Pass, allowing unlimited travel in Zones 1+2 for one year."
"Can I use Uber instead of public transport in Melbourne?","Yes, Uber and other rideshare services operate across Melbourne, offering a flexible transport option, though usually more expensive than Myki public transport."
"What’s the difference between Myki Money and Myki Pass?","Myki Money deducts the fare each time you travel (pay-as-you-go), while Myki Pass offers unlimited travel for a fixed period in selected zones."
"Do trams in the Melbourne CBD require Myki?","No, travel within the Free Tram Zone in Melbourne’s CBD does not require tapping on with Myki."
"Where can I plan my journey using Myki?","You can plan trips and check fare zones using the Public Transport Victoria (PTV) website or app."
"Can I combine Myki Pass and Myki Money?","Yes. A single Myki card can have a Myki Pass for your usual zones and Myki Money for occasional trips into other zones, including V/Line services."
"What is Mobile Myki?","Mobile Myki allows paying fares using a phone with Android 5.0+ and NFC via Google Pay. It creates a virtual adult or concession Myki card, free to set up, linked to a credit card. You can load Myki Money or certain Passes and touch on/off with your phone. It’s slower than a physical card and requires finding the phone’s NFC chip position."
"How fast is Mobile Myki for touching on and off?","Mobile Myki can be slower than a physical card. You need to find the phone’s NFC chip position for the quickest response. Newer card readers work better than older ones."
"Is Mobile Myki the same as using a Myki card?","Fares are the same, and you can load Myki Money or certain Passes (7, 28, 30, 31, 35, 40, 60, or 365 days). Mobile Myki can be registered to view travel history. Topping up via Google Pay is instant. It supports Auto Load but not discounted Passes or Commuter Club. It doesn’t work with vending or Quick Top-up machines."
"Is Mobile Myki available on iPhones?","Not yet. PTV is working on it, but there is no timeline."
"What about paying using contactless credit cards?","This is not available with Myki and is not expected soon."
"How does Myki work on V/Line?","Myki operates on V/Line commuter services but not long-distance services or buses, which use paper tickets. V/Line passengers need a Myki Pass for their entire journey with $0.00 Myki Money balance, sufficient Myki Money for the journey, or a combination. Myki Money users cannot use hybrid tickets. Additional time allowances apply for longer journeys (e.g., 2½ hours for 3–5 zones). Off-peak discounts (30%) apply outside peak times."
"Does the PTUA provide discounted Yearly tickets under the Commuter Club scheme?","Yes, PTUA members can buy discounted Yearly tickets (about 9% off) with a free Myki card. Commuter Club is metropolitan-only, but Zone 2 V/Line station passengers (e.g., Tarneit) are eligible."
"What should I do if my Myki card is lost or stolen?","For registered Mykis, report the loss ASAP by calling 1800 800 007, logging into your online Myki account, or visiting a PTV Hub. The balance is protected from the time you report it. Unregistered Mykis cannot protect or transfer balances. Replacements are available from PTV Hubs, online, or by phone."
"What do I do if my Myki is faulty or damaged?","Replace it at a Premium Metro station, staffed V/Line station, PTV Hub, online, or by post. If the card can’t be read, balance transfer takes up to 36 hours for Myki Pass or 7 days for Myki Money. You’ll need to top up the new card in the meantime."
"Can I get a refund if I no longer need the Myki Pass I purchased?","You can apply for a refund for a partly-used or unused Myki Pass or unused Myki Money online or via a paper form. Refunds are not available for expired Passes or the card purchase price. The refunded amount can be a cheque or transferred to another Myki. Converting Myki Pass to Myki Money takes up to 10 business days, cheque refunds up to 21 days."
"Can Myki be used to track my movements?","You can get an anonymous Myki from vending machines or over the counter. Registered Mykis offer balance protection and auto top-up but may share travel data per PTV’s privacy policy."
"Can someone else use my Myki card?","It’s legal for others to use your Myki if it only has Myki Money. Sharing a Myki with a Myki Pass is not allowed."
"Does the credit on my Myki expire if I haven’t used it for 90 days?","No, credit does not expire. However, online top-ups not collected within 90 days are archived and require reactivation (up to 24 hours) when you next use the card."
"Can I travel if my Myki has a negative or debit balance?","You can travel with a $0.00 balance for one or two-zone trips, but not for most V/Line journeys (more than two zones). A negative Myki Money balance invalidates a Myki Pass for travel."
"How do I touch on and touch off?","Touch your Myki flat on the reader when entering a station, tram, or bus, and when exiting (optional for trams). Don’t swipe or move it. It works within half a centimetre, possibly through a wallet unless other RFID cards interfere."
"Do I really need to touch on every time?","Yes, to validate your ticket, even if already valid for the journey. Exceptions are trams in the Free Tram Zone (CBD/Docklands). Touch on when boarding buses or at gated stations."
"Do I really need to touch off every time?","Yes, except on trams in Zone 1, to avoid default fares (e.g., two-zone fare). Myki Pass users in their nominated zones don’t need to touch off."
"Why don’t I have to touch off on trams?","Touching off is optional in Zone 1 to avoid congestion. For trams in the Zone 1/2 overlap (routes 75, 86, 109 ends), touch off to get the cheaper Zone 2 fare."
"Do I get charged for another 2-hours if I touch off after the expiry time?","No, your ticket is valid if you touch on before the expiry time."
"I heard weekly/monthly/yearly Passes aren’t valid on weekends.","Not true. Passes are valid on weekends in the zones paid for, but Zone 1-only Passes don’t cover Zone 2 travel, unlike the old Metcard system."
"Why does the information displayed on the reader vanish too quickly for me to read it?","Hold your card to the reader longer to view balance and deductions. Some new barrier readers don’t display information. Check balances at Myki Card Vending Machines or Myki Check machines."
"I’ve heard that a Myki card has an expiry date.","Myki cards expire four years after purchase. Check expiry at vending machines, Myki Check machines, by calling 1800 800 007, or via your online account. Replace free at staffed stations or PTV Hubs, with balance transferred."
"Does Myki Money always give me the best fare?","Myki Money gives the best daily fare, upgrading automatically (e.g., from 2-hour to Daily). It doesn’t upgrade to cheaper weekly/monthly Passes, which must be pre-loaded."
"I heard you have to pay extra if the train is late.","Not on trains, as you can touch on before expiry. On trams/buses, late arrivals after the 2-hour period may result in a daily fare for short trips."
"What’s the use of compensation being paid as Myki Money, when I have a Myki Pass?","Compensation for poor service (for 28+ day Pass users with 10+ travel days) is paid as Myki Money. Use it after your Pass expires, for other zones, on another card, or to buy your next Pass."
"Is Myki switching us to distance-based fares?","No, Myki uses zone-based fares, not distance-based like some cities."
"How do ticket inspectors and V/Line conductors check tickets?","They use handheld devices to read Myki cards, as little information is printed on the card."
"Has Myki slowed things down?","Yes, in some cases, like evening peak station exits. New Vix readers have improved bus response times. No single-use tickets increase delays for occasional users."
"Does Myki work properly?","Myki has issues, including no single-use tickets, limited top-up options, and slow readers. PTUA has suggested improvements like distinct touch-on/off sounds."
"Was Myki worth the money?","Probably not. The high cost could have been better spent on updating Metcard or a cheaper Smartcard system, with savings for more staff and services."
"What is the daily full fare cap for metropolitan travel in Victoria starting January 2025?","From 1 January 2025, the daily full fare cap is $11.00 for travel across the metropolitan network."
"What is the daily concession fare cap in Victoria from January 2025?","The daily concession fare cap is $5.50 for eligible concession card holders."
